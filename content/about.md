Hi, I'm Gautam Singh, a third-year senior at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Kolkata. I'm pursuing a 5-year BS-MS dual degree with a major in Mathematics and a minor in Computer Science.

I enjoy building and exploring solutions at the intersection of theory and application, with particular interests in theoretical computer science and statistical learning theory.

I also led the SlashDot programming club, where I fostered a community of over 600 science and mathematics enthusiasts through workshops, coding sessions, and contests.

P.S. Email is the best way to reach meâ€”I check it daily, while I might miss messages on social media.

You can find me on:
